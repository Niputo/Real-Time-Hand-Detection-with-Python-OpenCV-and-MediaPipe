# Real-Time-Hand-Detection-with-Python-OpenCV-and-MediaPipe
This script basically runs your webcam and then when your hand is on frame, it detects your fingers and palm and displays landmarks on them. This is my very first project. I made it in 2 days using AI (July 31 to August 1 2025). I'm completely new to coding but i hope it pays out in the end
