(BUILT WITH THE HELP OF AI. I GOT INSPIRED BY AN INSTAGRAM REEL WHERE A GIRL WAS DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS SO I TRIED TO MAKE SOMETHING LIKE HER)
# Real-Time-Hand-Detection-with-Python-OpenCV-and-MediaPipe
This script basically runs your webcam and then when your hand is on frame, it detects your fingers and palm and displays landmarks on them. This is my very first project. I made it in 2 days using AI (July 31 to August 1 2025). I'm completely new to coding but i hope it pays out in the end.

How to Run
Install Python 3.10 or 3.11

Install dependencies:

text
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
Save and run the script

text
python Revolution.py
Webcam window will open with hand landmarks tracking your palm and fingers in real time.

Press ESC to exit.
